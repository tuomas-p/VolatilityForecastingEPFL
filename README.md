# Stock Volatility Forecasting Using Twitter Data: An Empirical Study on Tesla's Stock and Elon Musk's Tweets
## Financial Econometrics (FIN-407), EPFL

### Abstract:
The increasing prevalence and influence of social media platforms like Twitter present a rich
source of data for financial market analysis. This study harnesses this dormant potential by in-
vestigating the predictive power of Twitter data, specifically Elon Musk’s tweets, on the volatil-
ity of Tesla’s stock. We employ natural language processing to extract relevant features from
the text and numerically represent sentiment. The study then examines the impact of these fea-
tures on stock volatility using a blend of well-established econometric and machine learning
techniques. Considering the unique position of Elon Musk as CEO and his notable influence on
the stock market through Twitter, the research aims at providing novel insights into the effect
of corporate communication on financial markets. Our results, while not entirely conclusive,
indicate that the sentiment variable might hold some predictive power, especially within the
framework of more complex models. This suggests a potential avenue for future exploration,
underscoring the nuanced role of sentiment analysis in the realm of financial forecasting. The
research culminates in a comparative analysis of all approaches, providing a comprehensive
view on the effectiveness and limitations of the different methods in the context of stock volatil-
ity forecasting using Twitter data. The outcomes of this research contribute to the evolving
field of volatility modelling by integrating unconventional data sources and diverse analytical
methodologies.

The details about the implementation can be found in the paper (`Oppitz_Paakkonen_ElGuindy_Khalfallah.pdf`).

**Important remark:** In order to reproduce the paper's results, the LSTM notebooks need to be
run exactly once after restarting the kernel, in the same exact order, with the same seeds.
